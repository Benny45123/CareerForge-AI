              I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer position at Amazon. As a Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in IoT, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain Technology, I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects at your company.

My experience with the MERN stack, particularly React and Node.js, aligns well with the requirements of this role. I have practical experience building scalable websites using APIs, as demonstrated by my personal portfolio website project, where I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create a clean and performant site. Furthermore, my familiarity with Git for version control ensures I can seamlessly integrate into a collaborative development environment.

Beyond my technical skills, I possess a strong foundation in Data Structures, Database Management, and Object-Oriented Programming with Java. I am confident that my academic background, combined with my hands-on project experience, makes me a well-rounded candidate for this opportunity. I am eager to learn new technologies and contribute to meaningful projects at Amazon.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of discussing my qualifications further.
